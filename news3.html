      <p style="padding-left: 85px; padding-right: 85px;">Central College is pleased to announce that this year its annual Science Week will feature both virtual speakers and live discussions and events. Running from March 21 to 25, speakers will cover topics from all STEM areas. The program includes the following speakers.

        On Monday March 21, Dr. Nikolas Provatas, Physics professor and Scientific Director of the McGill High Performance Computing Centre, McGill University, will give a talk entitled Exploring the Physics of Materials with Computational Modelling in which he will highlight theoretical developments used to model microstructure evolution of materials in nature as well as the computing techniques to simulate them.
        
        On Tuesday, March 22, three graduate students from Polytechnique Montréal, Jérôme Allard, Cat-Thy Dang, and Catherine Forest-Nault will introduce Central students to Chemical Engineering and present the research projects they are currently working on: the development of a surgical technique enabling the precise and safe treatment of an orthopedic joint pathology that affects pediatric patients; the development of a synthetic ligament to replace and help regrow ligaments torn in an accident; and using a specific biosensor to detect and differentiate different types of antibodies.
        
        On Wednesday, March 23rd, the launch of this year’s edition of SIGMA, a journal of science writings by Vanier students will take place in the STEM Centre at noon, after which, Central student Fadi Samaan will give a talk on Virtual Reality. The afternoon event will end with a ZOOM talk entitled Stem cells – the Future of Medicine and Health Research, by Dr. Benoît Laurent, Université de Sherbrooke. This lecture will discuss how stem cells can be used clinically and serve as a versatile tool for biomedical research.
        
        Thursday, March 24, at 4 pm, in A day in the life of an exoplanet researcher: the scientific method in action! Caroline Piaulet, Université de Montréal, will give a ZOOM talk on why she chose to pursue astrophysics research then describe her research on planets outside of our solar system.
        
        Friday, March 25, in a ZOOM talk at 10 am, entitled, Studying Physics at University, Patrick Horlaville, McGill University undergraduate student, will describe the environment and culture of undergraduate studies in physics and astrophysics at McGill.
        
        Friday afternoon, in the STEM Centre, students will describe their summer research internships. First, Central student Nandita Jayadevan, will talk about her internship under a Graduate Student at the CL:ASP psychology lab of Concordia University. Their research focused on Misophonia: a neuropsychological disorder where people have abnormally strong and negative reactions to the ordinary sounds humans make, such as chewing or breathing.
        
        Next, the McGill BioDesign Team will discuss current research and industry developments in biodesign and how it might help design innovative solutions for urgent global issues! The speakers will be: Zoe Goldberger, a 3rd year bioengineering student, Karim Mustafa a 1st year bioengineering student, and Grace Shi, a 1st year bioengineering student who is an outreach coordinator for BioDesign.</p>
